list:['hey', 'how', 'are', 'you']tuple:('hey', 'how', 'are', 'you')

 Write a Python program that:

    1. Accepts a sentence from the user.
    2. Splits the sentence into words and stores them in a **list**.
    3. Converts all words to **uppercase** and stores them in a **tuple**.
    4. Saves both the list and tuple into a file named **`sentence_data.txt`**.
    5. Reads back the data from the file and displays it on the screen.
